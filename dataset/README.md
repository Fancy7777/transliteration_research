2017.8.31
1. - is not cared.
2. there are some countries' transliteration is not really standard
3. no more findings


2017.9.2 - sad face. rest yesterday
1. map words with pronunciations aka phonetic symbols
2. Using cmudict-0.7b phones. dataset is in http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/
3. Using http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lextool.html to generate corresponding pronunciations
4. As the tool only allow limited size words as input. So use script to seperate the whole file into 6 parts and input
5. Combine all results into one using file
6. change format to '(english_word, chinese word)': location: if_has, pronunciation:__, etc:___ 

## fix last edit for easy use: change saving data format to '(english_word, chinese word)': location: if_has, pronunciation:__, etc:___
